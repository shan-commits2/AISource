## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get CoreAI up and running:

### 1. Create a Gemini API Key

1. Go to the [Gemini API website](https://developers.gemini.com)  
2. Sign up for a free account or log in if you already have one  
3. Navigate to your account dashboard and find the **API Keys** section  
4. Create a new API key  
5. Copy the generated API key â€” you will need it in the next steps

### 2. Configure CoreAI

1. Open the project folder on your computer  
2. Open the `script.js` file with a text editor (like VS Code, Notepad++, or even a simple text editor)  
3. Find the function or variable called `AskGemini`  
4. Replace the placeholder text `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_HERE"` with the API key you copied earlier. It should look something like this:

``js
  const res = await fetch('https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=YOUR_GEMINI_API_HERE;``
